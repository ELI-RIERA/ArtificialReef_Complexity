# ArtificialReef_Complexity
Script (Pyhton &amp; R) for Unleashing the Potential of Artificial Reefs Design:  A Purpose-Driven Evaluation of Structural Complexity

You'll find here two script :
* Python script to extract parameters from 3D CAD models (STL format) and compute complexity indexes (except fractal dimension)
* R script to compute fractal dimension on point clouds extracted from 3D CAD models

For your STL file be cautious to have watertight models otherwise the computation won't be comparable with the models from the study.
